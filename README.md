# AzureResume
Ariane's Azure resume

## Initial steps
- Frontend folder houses the resume design
- main.js containsvisitor count code

### Next in line
- Created the CosmosDB Database and container in Azure
- Created the Azure Functions project. Azure Functions Core Tools package was missing and needed to be installed. Without this package the "func" command would not be locally found. 
``` js
sudo npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools
```
